### WORK IN PROGESS ###

Making this public so I can test it!

Also a lot of the code was based of AirDrives code!

## Todo:
- [x] Remove https and http from website url 
- [ ] Add abilitly to find out how many website use the same password
- [ ] Maybe add a password generator as well
- [ ] Remove storage in main db make it private db online for more security
- [ ] Add ability to download saved passwords in a txt file 
- [ ] Add local = True, which enables local password manager using logins.txt file instead of online db
- [ ] Maybe make it eaiser to navigate between local and online password manager also polish interactive password creation
- [ ] Finish Local sofastorage
